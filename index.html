            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>My formal education is not in a technical area and I never taught I would like to become a programmer. 
                Till now I have worked with Marketing and Market Research and my interactions were mostly with databases and Microsoft Office Programs. 
                But with time, I’ve felt the need to evolve and to increase my knowledge.
                So now I’m a student at BeCode and learning how to code has proved to be challenging and interesting. </p>
